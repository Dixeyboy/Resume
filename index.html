    <p>Who is that handome fella...sorry</p>

    <p>Welcome to my Resume. I have experience of typing out Resume after resume using the same old boring template as everyone else. It is soul crushing.
       I love being creative and going against the grain.Thank god I can be creative here...with my webpage resume and be pretty candid.</p>
    
    <h2>statement</h2>

    <p>Statement...Statement...always found it difficult talking about myself, I absolutely hate it. I guess I am just a normal bloke with ADHD.
       I find it very difficult to concentrate, I cannot do mundane boring tasks again and again. My brain does not work with me. On the other hand,
       put me infront of something I enjoy doing (web development/coding) and I wil lsit there for hours upon hours, I will even forget to eat and drink.
       I am a little late to the web development party being 29, My guess would be people start in their teens or at school.
       anyway, generic stuff...I like working in a team and can work off my own initiative...blah blah blah...

        <h2>Education</h2>

     <p>None...Well not none exactly, I left school with pretty poor GCSE's. Schooling and ADHD do not mix. sit down, shut up, and read from this
        boring bulky text book and make notes. No interactivity, no fun, no personality. Suffice it to say I really struggled. Not with ALL 
        lessons though...Science with Mr Dunn was EPIC! You could get away with anything in that lesson as long as we did the work. 
        IT was awesome, especially the optional class I took with my mates. Had to film a music video (the song: Iron maiden's the trooper!)
        the lessons were spent outside rolling about in the grass and pretending to shoot each other...Yes, I was 15/16, so what.</p>
